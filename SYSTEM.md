# AI System Contract

This repository defines the canonical collaboration context
for all AI agents working on a codebase.

Rules:
- Files in this repository are authoritative.
- Constraints are hard requirements, not suggestions.
- Silent architectural or semantic decisions are forbidden.
- If conflict or ambiguity exists, stop and ask.
- Shared truth must be written, not remembered.
- `UI/` and `ICONS/` are canonical protocol context (not optional) and must not be removed without an explicit decision.
