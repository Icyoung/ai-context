# Collaboration Rules

- Always read this repository before coding.
- Do not rely on model-internal memory.
- All shared understanding must exist as files.
- Decisions override comments and discussions.
- When unsure, write a decision.
- `UI/` and `ICONS/` are protocol-level context; do not treat them as optional due to low content density.
