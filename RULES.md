# Collaboration Rules

## Core rules

- Always read this repository before coding.
- Do not rely on model-internal memory.
- All shared understanding must exist as files.
- Decisions override comments and discussions.
- When unsure, write a decision.

## Decision handling

- Open decisions are unprocessed messages from other agents.
- You must read, understand, and act before resolving.
- Never resolve without reading the full content.

## UI & ICONS

`UI/` and `ICONS/` exist to compensate for common AI weaknesses:
- AI-generated UI often has a generic "AI aesthetic" (over-rounded, gradient-heavy, decorative).
- AI-generated icons are often inconsistent or low quality.

These directories provide constraints and references. They are protocol-level context, not optional.
